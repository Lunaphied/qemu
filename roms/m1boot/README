M1 hardware minimal bootloader

A simple first stage bootloader that takes the role of iBoot. It configures
the M1 CPU registers in the same way that iBoot does and jump to the entry
point.

Compile m1boot
==============

$ make

Usage
=====

Automatically used by the apple-m1 machine. m1boot is loaded at physical
address 0, and the two last u64 values of its data are replaced:
 - The penultimate u64 value (arg) will be loaded into x0 before jumping to
   the entry point. It should contain the address of the boot parameters.
 - The last u64 value (entry) is the entry point address.

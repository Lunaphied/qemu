// Notes on this file:
// - This file doesn't actually represent the M1 very well, it's more a platform designed and focused around m1n1
// - The ARM IRQ pin is directly connected to the UART, which is helpful if you want to test the simplest 
//   interrupts possible
// - The structure of this file is based on the other board files I could find and me making my best guess
//   unfortunately that doesn't get you very far, and there's some not so great stuff here too just to tie
//   it all together to get an interesting demo
// - The "M1" core types are sort of emulated, but actual specific features like
//   the CP registers for fast IPIs and several of the other registers are not
//   implemented and this will need to be fixed so code that expects a real M1
//   doesn't get random exceptions
//
// One idea for this is to do what's suggested below and literally pull in a device tree (converted to
// not apple format) then use that to layout all the devices, creating stub regions of unimplemented registers
// until they're created. Unfortunately it seems like nothing else in qemu does this, not even the most modern
// code. So there's no framework, so that seems like it would be it's own project to prototype. 
// So for now we hardcode and make a few M1 helpers

     * the reset handler and use ROM regions (we want to replace these with RAM
     * that reloads on CPU reset or something)
     * 
     * NOTE: we cannot really use the helper functions from arm/boot.c because
     * loading elfs offers no control over the load address (it just uses the
     * physical values which are offset from 0 for m1n1), we also want to start
     * M1N1 with certain register and memory regions setup like iBoot would with
     * info about the hardware (Apple's form of DTB)
     * 
     * We want to support this boot process in addition to a semi-standard
     * "just load the kernel" method where we can directly load the kernel,
     * however to do that we need to patch a fdt so that it has the dynamic
     * info like CPU spintable addresses and framebuffer address. Since Linux
     * can be loaded directly we can just do this the standard way, but then
     * the code isn't really emulating an Apple M1 based Mac anymore, just a
     * ARM64 Mac with some of the M1's peripherals, which is a lot easier to
     * implement but not likely a good starting point if you want to also
     * support emulation of OS X which is indeed an important goal here.
     * 
     * For now we have a compromise. M1N1 is loaded as "firmware" which
     * essentially means we just grab the mach-o (which is intended to be loaded
     * as a flat image with a fixed entry point) and dump it into memory, setup
     * the required boot arguments (because only QEMU knows the values for
     * those) and jump in, with some helper code to dump a kernel, initrd and
     * dtb into memory so that proxy code can start it without copying it over
     * the serial port. When I pull in the latest M1N1 changes again this can
     * likely be changed to append the image like a concatenated M1N1 (but done
     * dynamically in QEMU) so the proxy part wouldn't be needed.
     * 
     * In the future we may want to support directly starting linux without
     * a bootloader if M1N1 isn't provided, this will likely be required for
     * upstream merge and offers helpful features like not having to fuss with
     * ADT stuff since a standard FDT can be easily constructed using QEMU
     * helpers.
     * 
     * TL;DR There's a plan for loading, for now it's almost the simplest thing
     * but not quite.

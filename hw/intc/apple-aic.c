/*
 * For a full description of the AIC interrupt controller read the
 * irq-apple-aic.c driver in the Linux kernel, the code is unrelated
 * but the peripheral is documented full there.
 * 
 * Below is extracted from https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/HW:AIC
 * 
 * Basic memory layout is:
 * 0x0000 ... 0x2000 - Global configuration
 * 0x2000 ... 0x3000 - Interrupts, ACKS, IPIs
 * 0x3000 ... 0x4000 - Target distribution (1 per reg, CPU mask in reg)
 * 
 * 0x0004            - Info register (lower bits store NR irqs)
 * 
 * 0x4000            - Software generated set bits
 * 0x4080            - Software generated clear bits
 * 0x4100            - IRQ mask set bits
 * 0x4180            - IRQ mask clear bits
 * 0x4200            - HW IRQ line status maybe?
 * 
 * 0x8020            - System timer (CNTPCT_EL0) low 32
 * 0x8028            - System timer (CNTPCT_EL0) high 32
 * 
 * 0x2000            - Current CPU id?
 * 0x2004            - IRQ reason
 * 0x2008            - IPI send
 * 0x200C            - IPI ack
 * 0x2024            - IPI mask set
 * 0x2028            - IPI mask clear
 * 
 * 0x5000            - per CPU view of 0x2004
 * Right now for development I've placed the "views" into other CPU's versions
 * of these registers at 0x5000, so far I'm just putting the reason
 * registers there. The normal reason will be handled by aliases that
 * redirect that region to the per-cpu region. This is going to need to
 * be more complete in the future and use the real offsets but for now
 * this will be enough.
 * TODO: above is not actually done, right now we just use a hack
 * since for single core the interrupt executer will always be called
 * as the same CPU. We *cannot* get the CPU from qemu (at least in my
 * opinion) as that will create a situation where we assume the current
 * CPU is always an ARM cpu or compattible, which isn't ideal for a peripherial
 * instead it will just error if a CPU hasn't been hooked up properly.
